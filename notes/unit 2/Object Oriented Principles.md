Object-oriented principles are fundamental concepts that guide the design and implementation of software using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. These principles help in creating modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems. The main object-oriented principles are:

1. **Encapsulation:**
    
    - **Definition:** It involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.
    - **Purpose:** It helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.
2. **Abstraction:**
    
    - **Definition:** Abstraction focuses on the essential features of an object while ignoring the non-essential details.
    - **Purpose:** It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on their relevant characteristics.
3. **Inheritance:**
    
    - **Definition:** Inheritance allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass/base class).
    - **Purpose:** It promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical structure.
4. **Polymorphism:**
    
    - **Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.
    - **Purpose:** It enables flexibility by allowing the same method to be used for different types of objects.
5. **Association:**
    
    - **Definition:** Association represents a relationship between two or more classes where objects of one class are related to objects of another class.
    - **Purpose:** It helps in modeling complex systems by defining how different classes interact with each other.
6. **Composition:**
    
    - **Definition:** Composition is a form of association where one class contains an object of another class.
    - **Purpose:** It promotes code reuse and allows for creating complex objects by combining simpler ones.
7. **Dependency:**
    
    - **Definition:** Dependency occurs when one class relies on another class but does not own an instance of it.
    - **Purpose:** It allows for loosely coupled systems, making changes in one class less likely to affect others.

These principles collectively contribute to the design goals of OOP, including modularity, reusability, maintainability, and extensibility. Applying these principles helps in building robust and scalable software systems.
