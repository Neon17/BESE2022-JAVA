HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext over the internet. HTTP defines a set of methods and responses that are used by clients and servers to communicate. Here's an overview of some common HTTP methods and responses:

### HTTP Methods:

1. **GET**: Requests data from a specified resource. It should have no side effects on the server (i.e., it should not modify data).

2. **POST**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. It might result in a change in state on the server.

3. **PUT**: Updates a resource or creates a new resource if it does not exist at the specified URL.

4. **DELETE**: Requests the removal of a resource identified by a given URL.

5. **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.

6. **HEAD**: Requests the headers of a specified resource, similar to GET, but without the actual data.

7. **OPTIONS**: Describes the communication options for the target resource.

8. **TRACE**: Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

### HTTP Responses:

HTTP responses are returned by the server to provide information about the status of the requested resource.

1. **1xx (Informational)**: Indicates an interim response. For example, `100 Continue` is commonly used to continue a request that might be too large for the server to handle.

2. **2xx (Successful)**: Indicates that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. For example, `200 OK` is the standard response for successful HTTP requests.

3. **3xx (Redirection)**: Indicates that further action needs to be taken to complete the request. For example, `301 Moved Permanently` indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.

4. **4xx (Client Error)**: Indicates that the client seems to have made an error. For example, `404 Not Found` is returned when the server cannot find the requested resource.

5. **5xx (Server Error)**: Indicates that the server failed to fulfill a valid request. For example, `500 Internal Server Error` is a generic server error message.
